The PennyLane Q# plugin integrates the Q# quantum computing framework with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit>`_ is an open-source
library for quantum programming using the .NET Q# quantum programming language. Resulting quantum programs
can be executed using built in local simulators, or via the cloud-based Azure quantum simulator.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

The documentation can be found `here <https://pennylane-qsharp.readthedocs.io>`_.

Features
========

* Provides a Microsoft QDK device to be used with PennyLane: ``microsoft.QuantumSimulator``.
  This provides access to the local full state simulator.


* All provided devices support all core qubit PennyLane operations and observables.


* Provides custom PennyLane operations to cover additional Q# operations, including
  ``T``, ``S``, ``ISWAP``, ``CCNOT``, ``PSWAP``, and many more. Every custom operation
  supports analytic differentiation.


* Combine Microsoft Azure quantum simulators with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.

Installation
============

 Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using ``pip``:

   	$ python -m pip install pennylane-qsharp


Make sure you are using the Python 3 version of pip.

Alternatively, you can install PennyLane Q# from the source code by navigating to the top directory and running
::

	$ python setup.py install

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PennyLane Q# requires the following libraries be installed:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`_ >= 3.6
* `IQ# <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/index?view=qsharp-preview>`_

as well as the following Python packages:

* `PennyLane <http://pennylane.readthedocs.io/>`__ >= 0.11.0
* `Q# <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/python?view=qsharp-preview>`_

If you currently do not have Python 3 installed, we recommend
`Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_, a distributed version of
Python packaged for scientific computation.


Software tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that PennyLane Q# is working correctly after installation,
the test suite can be run by navigating to the source code folder and running
::

	$ make test


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run
::

  $ make docs

The documentation can then be found in the ``doc/_build/html/`` directory.
